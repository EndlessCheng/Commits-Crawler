5. |WebContents::GetNativeView| is removed. Using ->GetView()->GetNativeView();
6. |JavaScriptDialogCreator| is renamed to |JavaScriptDialogManager|
7. Several method in the base class |content::MediaObserver| of |MediaInternals|

8. Base class: |content::ContentClient| add method |GetDataResourceBytes|, so
   |content::ShellContentClient| should also override it.
